# Coq Experiments

This repository contains my Coq Experiements, which I created while reading through [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/) by Adam Chlipala.

Run these files from CoqIDE, you'll need to set the following `coqtop` arguments.  These can be set in the `Tools -> Coqtop` menu.

```
-R $repo_root/coq_experiments/cpdt/src Cpdt
```

Where `$repo_root` is the directory containing this `README.md` file.
